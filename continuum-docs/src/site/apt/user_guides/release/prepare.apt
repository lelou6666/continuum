Prepare for Release

 Navigate to the <<Project Group Summary>> and click the <<Release>> button or icon.

[../../images/release-project-group-summary.png] Release

 Choose <<Prepare project for release>> and click <<Submit>>.

 Complete the form, providing the SCM tag name, etc.

 Check the <<Use edit mode>> checkbox if you are using an SCM system that requires you to obtain a lock before editing.

 Click <<Submit>>.
 
 When releasing in a {{{../../administrator_guides/distributed-builds.html} distributed builds}} setup, a <<Build environment>>
 should be selected containing at least one enabled build agent. If none is selected, then Continuum will attempt to use
 a default agent, starting with the one last used to build the project.

 Furthermore, the release will not happen in the following cases:
 
   * no build agent found in the build agent group attached to the build environment
   
   * all build agents configured in the selected build environment are disabled

 Wait for the process to complete, then click <<Done>>.

 <<Note:>> Hitting the <<Rollback>> button does not roll back or delete the SCM tag created during the <<<scm-tag>>> phase.
 So when re-doing the release prepare of the same version, make sure that the tag does not exist in SVN, if so,
 the tag should be manually deleted.
