Wagon Notification

  [[1]] Under <<Notifiers>> from the <<Project Information>> page, click <<Add>>.

  [[2]] On the <<Add Notifier>> form select <<Wagon>> from the pull-down menu and click <<Submit>>.

  [[3]] On the next page, enter the Project Site URL.

  It must be a Wagon URL like the URL used in <<<distributionManagement>>>. For the Webdav protocol,
  you can use <<<dav:[http_url]>>>, or <<<file:///path_to_the_directory>>> if you want to copy it locally
  with the file protocol.

  [[4]] Enter the ServerId. This should match the value of the <<<\<id\>>>> in the server configuration found in
  <<<settings.xml>>>. Sample configuration follows:

+------+
  <server>
    <username>admin</username>
    <password>admin123</password>
    <id>continuum.site</id>
  </server>
+------+

  Using the server configuration in <<<[user_home]/.m2/settings.xml>>> is a workaround
  for user authentication using the Wagon notifier.

  The <<<\<username\>>>> and <<<\<password\>>>> should be set to the user account that has the <<Site
  Producer>> and <<Site Observer>> roles.

  [[5]] Select the <<Send on ...>> options you want.

  [[6]] Click <<Save>>. The Wagon notifier you just added will be listed under <<Notifiers>> on the <<Project
  Information>> page along with the other notifiers you may have set up prior to this.

  []

  The file protocol will create a <<<buildresult.txt>>> file locally in the location specified in the
  Wagon Notifier configuration. If you use the Webdav protocol, a <<<buildresult.txt>>> file will
  be copied to your disk, relative to where you told it to be placed when you set up the Wagon
  notifier.

  You can also view the <<<buildresult.txt>>> file from a browser at the Project Site URL you specified.
