Continuum Security Configuration

 Security properties and password rules can be configured in the
 <<<security.properties>>> file, which by default is searched for in:

   * <<<~/.m2/security.properties>>>
  
   * <<<$CONTINUUM_BASE/conf/security.properties>>>

   * <<<$CONTINUUM_HOME/conf/security.properties>>>

   []

 (In the list above, <<<~>>> is the home directory of the user who is running
 Continuum, and <<<$CONTINUUM_HOME>>> is the directory where Continuum is installed,
 such as <<</opt/continuum-1.2>>>.)

~~TODO: Link to Redback documentation when available

 Following are some of the properties you can modify.  For a complete list,
 consult the default properties file in Redback's svn repo:
 {{{http://svn.codehaus.org/redback/redback/trunk/redback-configuration/src/main/resources/org/codehaus/plexus/redback/config-defaults.properties}
 config-defaults.properties}}

 <<Note:>> If installed standalone, Continuum's list of configuration files is <itself> configurable, and
 can be found in:
 <<<$CONTINUUM_HOME/apps/continuum/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/plexus/application.xml>>>

* Additional CSRF Prevention

  To help prevent cross-site request forgery, it is possible to enable a basic check that the referrer is the current
  site.

  <Note:> This is only a generic solution that may prevent some types of attacks but not others. It may cause problems
  with certain user agents. By default, the check is off.

  To enable the check, change the following configuration value in the <<<struts.xml>>> file in the <<<WEB-INF/classes>>>
  directory of the web application (2 locations):

----
<interceptor-ref name="redbackSecureActions">
  <param name="enableReferrerCheck">false</param>
</interceptor-ref>
