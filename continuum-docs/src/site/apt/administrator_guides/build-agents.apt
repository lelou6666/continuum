Managing Build Agents

  Before this, you may want to enable the Distributed Builds option in the {{{./configuration.html}General Configuration}}
  and {{{../installation/build-agent.html}install a Build Agent}}, or read about the {{{./distributed-builds.html}Distributed
  Builds}} feature.

  From the menu, choose the <<Build Agents>> item

[../images/build-agents-menu.png] Build Agents Menu

  You will see a list of the existing Build Agents, if any.

[../images/build-agents.png] Build Agents List

  To add a new Build Agent, click the <<Add>> button.
  You will be prompted to enter the Build Agent URL and Description.


  To edit an existing Build Agent, click the <<Edit>> link to the right of the entry.
  You will be prompted to edit the Build Agent Description.

  <<Note:>> Once a Build Agent has been saved you can not change its URL.

  Be sure to enable the agent by checking the <<Enabled>> checkbox.

  After you save your changes, verify that the <<Enabled>> checkbox is checked.  If it is not checked, most likely Continuum was unable to ping
  the agent.  Consult the log file for additional information.
