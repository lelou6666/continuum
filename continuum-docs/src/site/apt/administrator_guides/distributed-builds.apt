Understanding Distributed Builds

* Introduction

    The Distributed Builds is an extension to the base Continuum
    functionalities that gives us the ability to process multiple independent
    builds beyond the capacity of a single server's processing power.  It also
    enables us to execute builds on multiple different platforms while
    retaining a unified view of all project builds.

* Architecture

    Continuum follows a Client-Server model using XML-RPC as the protocol.
    However, since it uses a bi-directional XML-RPC implementation, we instead
    distinguish the components by calling them Master and Build Agent.

    The Master is a Continuum instance that has the ability to
    delegate the builds to registered Build Agents.

    The Build Agent is a standalone Jetty-bundled webapp that
    listens for any build requests from the Master it is
    assigned to.

    There is a one-to-many relationship between the Master and the Build Agents.
    A Master may have many Build Agents, but each Build Agent can only have one Master.

* Behavior

    Distributed Builds happen at the project group level of Continuum.
    When the entire project group is built in the Master, independent projects
    (single project or multi-module project) are distributed to a single
    registered Build Agent.

    In a project group containing a mix of projects, the distribution of work
    goes through the following steps:

    [[1]] In the Master, a build in the project group is triggered.

    [[2]] Every independent project within the project group is identified,
    whether as a single project or a multi-module project.  Projects with
    inter-dependencies cannot be distributed separately, so multi-module
    projects are delegated to a Build Agent as one build.

    [[3]] For each independent project, the Master iterates over the list of
    registered Build Agents and queries each if available.  The query is an XML-RPC
    <<<ping()>>> followed by a <<<getBuildSizeOfAgent()>>> invocation.

    [[4]] If there is a Build Agent available, the Master collects the information
    necessary for the build (SCM URL, project id, etc.) and passes it when
    invoking <<<buildProjects()>>> to the Build Agent with the smallest number of
    tasks in its queue. The Master also passes the <<<name>>> of the local repository
    of the project's project group. Make sure that a local repository with the same <<<name>>>
    is configured in the Build Agent's configuration file since that is what will be 
    used when the project is built in the build agent. Otherwise, it will use the 
    local repository set in the build agent's <<<settings.xml>>> file.

    [[5]] In the Build Agent, the build request is processed: the build is queued and
    executed.  Upon execution, the Build Agent first performs an SCM checkout or an SCM
    update followed by an SCM changelog to get the latest update date, then the actual build follows.

    [[6]] At this point, when the build is running, the Master can invoke
    <<<cancelBuild()>>> which returns a transient build result, and
    <<<getBuildResult()>>> that updates the build output viewed in the Master.

    [[7]] After the build, the Build Agent returns the complete build result to the
    Master by invoking the callback method <<<returnBuildResult()>>>, which the
    Master aggregates to provide a unified view of projects.

    A <<<ping()>>> is always called before each XML-RPC invocation to check if 
    the agent is available. If it's not, the agent will be disabled.

~~TODO: insert sequence diagram here

* Setup

    * {{{./configuration.html}Enable}} the Distributed Builds option and set the Shared Secret Password in the General Configuration.

    * {{{../installation/build-agent.html}Install and Configure}} one or more Build Agents.

    * {{{./build-agents.html}Add}} your Build Agents to the Continuum Master.

    * {{{./build-agent-groups.html}Add}} your Build Agents to a Build Agent Group.

    * {{{./buildEnvironment.html} Add}} your Build Agent Group to a Build Environment.

    * Configure a project to use that Build Environment.

    * Make sure that the {{{./localRepository.html} local repository}} of the {{{./projectgroup.html} project group}} is properly configured.
    In this case, it should point to the path of the repository where the Build Agent is installed/running.

    []

    <<Warning:>> You need to have a central remote repository to store the artifacts created from the Build Agent so that other agents will be able to use the new artifacts.

* Limitations

    * Only system administrator can enable/disable distributed builds

    * Credentials (i.e. svn credentials) are passed along if specified, but if server cache is used it will need to be done individually on the Build Agents

    * There is no tracking of SCM changes

    * The Build Agent needs a configuration web interface

    * All projects in a project group will be distributed to the same Build Agent

* Future Enhancements

    * Remote builders

        * Builders can be installed on remote machines, a Continuum manager will send actions to run to builders. An action can be something to run on all builders, on some of them or eventually only to an available builder if we don't want to run more than one build. Actions can be sent with JMS and builders can apply some filters if they don't want to receive all actions. With that, we can do some parallel builds but the dependency tree must be respected for the build order. To work correctly with dependencies, each builder must use a central local repository. Maybe we can use an internal Archiva.

        * With Continuum builders configured to receive all commands, users can run multi-platform build for each build definition execution.

        * With Continuum builders configured to receive only some project types, users can use a different builder by project group. In this case, the build of all projects will be done quickly because commands are balanced on several servers.

        * With Continuum builders configured to build something when it is available, users can install builders on several machine to balance the charge. In this case, it will be possible to run some parallel builds.

        * When the builders work is done, a message will be sent to the manager to notify the end of the process.

        * With JMS used for the communication, we can add some listeners to create reports/statistics, log some information.

    * Policy-based distribution

        * Next available

        * Load balanced

        * Targeted environment matching
