    Builds sent from a master specifying a local repository name will use localRepository configuration matching its
    name *exactly*. If the named repository is not found, it will use the default user's settings. For example, with no
    configured localRepositories:

    master requests build using 'DEFAULT' or 'another'  ->  agent uses ${settings.localRepository}

    While building will default to user settings, purging is only supported for configured repositories. For example,
    with no configured localRepositories:

    master sends purge using 'DEFAULT'  ->  agent fails to purge anything

    In contrast, if you configure the DEFAULT repository the purge will be attempted.
